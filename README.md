# svoiptunnel
SIP voip tunel application

This is a small unfinished project for a secure SIP voip tunnel application.
The code is built to support multiple protocols and currently the following are implemented:
- dtls (secure udp)
- tls (secure tcp)
- tcp (unsecure)
- udp (unsecure)

The following protocols were planned initially but not yet implemented:
- http
- https
- websockets

The application can be targetted for Linux or Windows and current version has Linux Makefile included.

Enjoy.
